# This is the Origin

I've been trying to stand up a blog for a while now. I've ranged from thinking
up an entire architecture in my head from back-end to front-end, picking out 
which technologies and frameworks I'll use, to slamming a quick wordpress site
up, to actually building something using gh-pages on github.  That is all the
primordial soup from which this blog will be born.  This site will start rough
and build into something more robust as both time and my ever-improving skills
improve.

The purpose of this blog is mostly personal.  That is, this is a training camp
for my mind, both in terms of technical skills as well as those of the writer.
I intend to make the process publishing what I write as frictionless as possible
so that doing so can become the _easy_ part of the process. This is post 1 of 
(hopefully) many on a site that doesn't exist yet. 

See you soon.
